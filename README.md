# CTF Notes and Writeups Repository

This repository is a personal collection of code snippets & scripts from CTFs challenges I’ve solved—either from my own practice or featured on [my channel](https://www.youtube.com/@strikoder). The primary goal of this repo is to serve as structured notes for future reference and tools usage.

## How to Use

1. Press `.` in your browser when viewing this repository on GitHub to launch the Visual Studio Code interface.
2. Use the search function (`Ctrl+Shift+F`) to look for:
   - A specific CTF machine or challenge by name

   - Vulns (`CVE-2021-1675`, `PrintNightmare`)
   - Keywords related to privilege escalation or misconfig


## What's Inside

- Solutions for publich CTFs
- Custom scripts and payloads 
- CVE-based exploit samples and test cases


## Notes

- Only CTF content with explicit permission for public disclosure will be published here.
- This repository is maintained as a personal knowledge base, not as a tutorial site or complete guide. If you prefer in-depth walkthroughs, check out [0xdf’s writeups](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/)
- Structure and organization may evolve over time based on usage and scale.

Feel free to fork or reference for your own studies, but always solve challenges on your own first.

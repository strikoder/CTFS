# CTF Notes and Writeups Repository

This repository is a personal collection of code snippets, scripts, and writeups from Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges I’ve solved—either from my own practice or featured on my channel. Where permission allows, solutions and walkthroughs are included. The primary goal of this repo is to serve as structured notes for future reference and tool usage.

### What's Inside

- Solutions for machines and challenges (when permitted to share)
- Custom scripts and payloads used during exploitation
- Notes and usage examples for tools and techniques
- CVE-based exploit samples and test cases

### How to Use

To explore the repo effectively:

1. Press `.` in your browser when viewing this repository on GitHub to launch the Visual Studio Code interface.
2. Use the search function (`Ctrl+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+F`) to look for:
   - A specific CTF machine or challenge by name
   - A tool (e.g., `nmap`, `impacket`, `kerbrute`)
   - A vulnerability or CVE (e.g., `CVE-2021-1675`, `PrintNightmare`)
   - Keywords related to privilege escalation or misconfiguration

### Notes

- Only CTF content with explicit permission for public disclosure will be published here.
- This repository is maintained as a personal knowledge base, not as a tutorial site or complete guide.
- Structure and organization may evolve over time based on usage and scale.

Feel free to fork or reference for your own studies, but always solve challenges on your own first.
